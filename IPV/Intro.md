- IP address is 4 sets of numbers. with ip address computers can talk to each other on internet or in same network.
1. A switch is a key device for communication within a local network (LAN).
Switch vs. Router – How They Work Together - 
A switch is responsible for redirecting traffic within a LAN by using MAC addresses and forwarding frames.
A router is responsible for connecting different networks (like your LAN to the Internet) by using IP addresses and forwarding packets.

# How a Frame Works in a Network
📌 Example:
🔹 Your PC sends a request to a printer in the same LAN.

🔹 It creates an Ethernet frame:
Destination MAC: Printer’s MAC 
Source MAC: Your PC’s MAC
Data: “Print this document”

🔹 The switch reads the destination MAC and forwards the frame to the printer.
🔹 The printer extracts the data and prints the document.

# Why switches needed when routers can manage lan and internet - 
1. Switches work at Layer 2 (MAC addresses) and operate with frames, which are processed much faster than packets at Layer 3 (IP addresses).
2. Switches handle local traffic faster and reduce the load on routers.
3. Instead of Computer A sending data directly to Computer B via a switch (which is fast), the router would have to process and forward every single packet, even if it’s staying inside the LAN.
4. Computer A sends data to Computer B within the LAN → Switch quickly forwards the data using MAC addresses, No need to involve the router, making it much faster.

# Why Does the Router Send the Response to the Switch?
The router knows your device's private IP (because of NAT – Network Address Translation).
But since the router is usually connected to a switch, it sends the response to the switch.
The switch checks its MAC address table and delivers the data to your device.

# Final Answer:
💡 Yes, removing the switch would overload the router and slow down LAN communication! 🚀

# for multi network connection or internet - 
You have 1 router with 2 network interfaces (one for each network)

Each network interface has its own CIDR block
For example: Interface 1: 192.168.1.0/24 and Interface 2: 192.168.2.0/24

Devices in Network 1:
Get IP addresses from the 192.168.1.0/24 range (like 192.168.1.5, 192.168.1.6, etc.)
Their default gateway is 192.168.1.1 (the router's IP address on that network)
NOT the entire CIDR block, but specifically the router's IP address on that network

Devices in Network 2:
Get IP addresses from the 192.168.2.0/24 range
Their default gateway is 192.168.2.1 (the router's IP address on that network)

The default gateway for a device is not the CIDR block itself, but rather the specific IP address that the router uses on that network interface. This is the entry/exit point that devices use to communicate with other networks.
When a device wants to send data to another network, it sends the data to its default gateway (the router's IP on its network), and the router then forwards it to the appropriate network.

# MAC -  
Mac address is 12 digits address (physical address).
1. on window - ipconfig /all |findstr "Description Physical address"
2. on mac - ifconfig en0 | grep ether

# ARP (address resolution protocol) - 
ARP is needed to translate IP to MAC and used only within lan.
- when a laptopA wants to connect with laptopB then it needs mac of B and only then via switch it con connect, so A ask ARP table and if ARP has corresponding mac then it gives to A or ARP brodcast message asking "hey device with IP ....., give me your mac" and then get mac of that ip (from laptopB) and thats it.
now laptopA has mac and ip and it can now send request and due to mac address, now switch will make this connection.

- to check private ip - ifconfig | grep "inet "
